          Podcasts are a fantastic way to learnâ€”they're informative, engaging,
          and just plain fun. Listening to podcasts that match your learning stage boosts your
          listening skills, expands your vocabulary, and even lets you practice
          reading with transcripts. Why not use them to learn a language faster
          and more effectively? That's exactly what we intend to do!
        </p>
        <p>
          Linguocast initial mission is to curate the ultimate podcast catalog
          for language learners, from beginners to advanced. This is too big of a
          task for one person, or even a
          whole company. That's why we decided to rely in the language learning
          vibrant community. As they discover their next favorite learning podcast, in
          turn, they share with others those hidden gems they've found along the way!
          Other ways of contributing is by suggest edits, comment and review shows,
          join our Discord to help shape the future of the platform, or even
          develop/design new features.

          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ezequiel Santiago, a software engineer from Uruguay
          and the founder of Linguocast.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might have guessed, I'm a huge podcast fan. I love listening to
          shows about tech, politics, nutrition, and farming every now and then.
          Plus, I've been studying Chinese for over 10 years and even lived in
          China and Taiwan for three years! Chinese learning podcasts have been
          a game-changer for my listening skills and vocabulary.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love building thingsâ€”whether it's woodworking, electronics, or
          software. When I couldn't find the perfect platform to harness the
          power of podcasts for learning, I decided to take the initiative.
        </p>
