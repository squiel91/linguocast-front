          Our goal is to foster an inclusive community focused on the language
          learning experience. We expect comments to be respectful and relevant
          to the content. Offensive, discriminatory, or excessively personal
          comments are not allowed. Comments flagged as offensive will be reviewed
          and may be censored. Users with multiple censored comments or those who
          post content that is flagrantly discriminatory or incites violence or
          self-harm will be banned. Moderators will review and determine each case
          based on its merits.
